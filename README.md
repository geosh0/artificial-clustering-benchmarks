# Artificial Dataset Processing

This repository focuses on the processing of artificial datasets and the subsequent application of various clustering models. As our baseline, we utilize standard algorithms such as K-Means, Spectral Clustering and Agglomerative Clustering. 

Additionally, we evaluate two specialized clustering models: **RLAC** and **MDH** (both of which are hosted in their own respective repositories). The RLAC implementation was developed as the primary focus of my thesis. MDH was integrated concurrently to broaden the scope of the comparative analysis, providing a more comprehensive evaluation of the clustering results.
